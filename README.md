# About
The Public Involvement Data Specification (PIDS) was started by PI practitioners and developers at HNTB. It is a set of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) focused on public engagement and equity. Inspired by projects like GTFS and GBFS, the goals of PIDS are to provide a standardized way for agencies to ingest, compare and analyze data from public meetings, and to give agencies the ability to promote project awareness, public sentiment, and data exchange through standardized formats.
