# About
The Public Involvement Data Specification (PIDS), a project of HNTB PI practitioners and developers, is a set of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) focused on public engagement and equity. Inspired by projects like GTFS and GBFS, the goals of PIDS are to provide a standardized way for agencies to ingest, compare and analyze data from public meetings, and to give agencies the ability to promote project awareness, public sentiment, and equity through standardized formats.
